# Android Studio Installation

To get started with developing Android applications, you will need to install Android Studio.

You can download the latest version of Android Studio, currently code-named "Flamingo", from the [official Android Studio website](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Project Setup

After installing Android Studio, you can download the project zip and extract it to a convenient location on your computer.

Next, open the project in Android Studio and wait for the project to build and sync with your system.

Please note that this app was compiled using JDK 11 and Gradle 8, which are used in the "Flamingo" version of Android Studio. If you are using an older version of Android Studio, the app may not work properly.

## Emulator Setup

Once your project is ready, you can start the app in an emulator.

For instructions on how to set up and use the Android emulator, refer to the [official Android Studio documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
